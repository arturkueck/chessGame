# chessGame
Encountered Bugs: 
Not all chess rules are implemented. No Bugs with possible configurations. Sometime laggy runetime due to resizing of the frame.

You can start the frontend/main.java without runparametes to get a plain chessboard with no configurationpossibility and a notation of the moves you are doing.

you can give up to 3 parameters for the main-method:
"fieldnames"
"colorpicker"
"rotator"

fieldnames:
You can check a checkbox for showing and higind the names of the fields

colorpicker:
You get two colorpickers for the by default white and brown squares. Now you can choose your own fieldbackground. 
Advise 1: Dont take a black background as you wount be able to see the black pieces anymore. The fieldnames are always visible.
Advise 2: Dont make the by default white squares darken then the by default black squares.

rotator:
You can check a checkbox to rotate the black pieces around. Can be nice if you want to play with a friend on e.g. a tablet laying on a table.
